# Mission-to-Mars

# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the scraping of a specific mars website with the outputs of those scraping data. 
To do this I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
